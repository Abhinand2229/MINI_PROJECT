# Program-Outcome Attainment Analysis

The current system involves manual calculation of Program Outcome (PO) attainment levels for each semester, subject, and batch using Excel, which is a time-consuming process. Our project aims to automate this task. The proposed system allows users to input internal marks, external marks, and the co-po matrix for each subject. Subsequently, the system will automatically calculate and output the PO attainment level for the subject.
                   
This project is centred on the assessment and analysis of Program Outcome (PO) attainment. Each program spans multiple semesters, encompassing a variety of subjects, and is designed to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills in the relative field. The primary objective of this project is to evaluate and analyse the extent to which  students achieve the specified POs throughout the duration of their program, with a primary focus on determining the final PO attainment levels.
